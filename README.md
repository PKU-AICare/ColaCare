# ColaCare: Enhancing Electronic Health Record Modeling through Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration

ColaCare is a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent collaboration. This project aims to improve clinical prediction tasks by combining the strengths of domain-specific expert models and general-purpose LLMs.

## Key Features

1. **EHR-Specific Multi-Agent Framework**: ColaCare integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data analysis and text-based reasoning capabilities.
2. **Collaborative Decision-Making Process**: The framework employs doctor agents and a meta doctor agent to simulate real-world medical consultations, ensuring comprehensive analysis of patient health records.
3. **Medical Guideline Support**: ColaCare incorporates authoritative medical guidelines using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, grounding predictions in current medical knowledge.
4. **Enhanced Predictive Performance**: Experiments on four real-world EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in mortality prediction tasks compared to existing EHR-specific models.
5. **Interpretable Insights**: The framework generates detailed, interpretable reports for each prediction, potentially revolutionizing clinical decision support systems.
