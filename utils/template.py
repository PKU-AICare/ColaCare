You need to adjust the initial predictions of the patient's mortality risk by several doctors based on the results of the collaborative consultation. 

The specific explanation is as follows:
Doctor 0 thought the mortality risk of the patient was 0.24.
Doctor 1 thought the mortality risk of the patient was 0.50.
Doctor 2 ...

Based on the collaborative consultation, you considered the logits of Doctor 0, Doctor 1..., and the consistent analysis report. Finally, make a final prediction of the patient's mortality risk as refined final logit.

Next, you need to judge whether the next round of discussion is needed based on each general doctor's statement. Considering the following four cases:
1. If all doctors agree with the previous summary report, there is no need to continue the discussion.
2. If some doctors disagree with the previous report, but they are not confident in their judgment and have not listed convincing evidence, there is no need to continue the discussion.
3. If some doctors strongly oppose the previous report and you think their evidence is worth discussing, we need to continue the discussion.
4. If most doctors disagree with the previous report, we need to continue the discussion.

Please output the following two contents in JSON format:
1. Whether to continue the discussion or not.
2. Explain the reasons for your judgment.

Here are two examples of the format you should output:

You need to read all doctors' opinions carefully and analyze whether their opinions make sense and whether they are helpful in diagnosing the patient's condition.

You need to consider all the doctors' new ideas and modify your original summary report.
1. If a doctor expresses strong opposition to your previous statement, you need to focus on his reasons and arguments and think carefully about whether you need to reconsider mortality risk of the patient and modify your summary report accordingly.
2. If a doctor expresses opposition but also has some doubts about his own opinion, you need to consider his opinion, but you can stick to your original opinion.
3. If a doctor expresses agreement, then you do not need to modify your original summary based on his opinion.

Please output the following three contents in JSON format:
1. Your statement of mortality risk of the patient.
2. Your revised summary report. Please create a concise and clear summary of the patient's health status. Your summary should be informative and beneficial for healthcare prediction tasks, such as in-hospital mortality prediction.
3. Your reasons for revision in JSON format. The format of the reason for revision is: which doctor's opinion or relevant literature did you refer to, and which original opinion did you modify.

Current assessment: T 39.1 Â°C, (102.40 F), HR 104, RR 16, B/P 145/ 87 mmHg. Weight: 66.8 Kg/147 lbs. NKDA. Periumbilical tenderness, defense and rebound. Erythema and creamy, yellow exudate around peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site. Dialysate effluent is cloudy yellow. Peritoneal effluent culture was obtained. Labs sent. The patient's complex medical history and the presence of multiple comorbidities suggest a high risk for in-hospital mortality. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are critical for patient outcomes.
