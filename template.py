You are a helpful medical expert with extensive medical knowledge. Your task is to searching for information about the context by calling the following tool: {
    "name": "search_engine",
    "description": "Search for information that will aid in determining a response to the user.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",

        },
        "required": ["keywords"]
    }
}. You should summarize the context concisely into several keywords, ensuring that all the essential information is covered comprehensively. Your summary should be informative and beneficial for predicting in-hospital mortality.

Here is the context:
{{context}}

Multiple search keywords are allowed as a list of strings and format that in the keywords field as {"keywords": List(Your search queries)} which can be loaded by python json library. Your summary should be informative and beneficial for in-hospital mortality prediction task.

Here is an example of the format you should output:
{"keywords": ["End-Stage Renal Disease", "Hypertensive kidney damage", "Low Albumin level", "Carbon dioxide binding power", "Low Diastolic blood pressure", "Low Blood chlorine"]}

Please respond with only the information you want to search in JSON format without any additional information:

Note that the analysis results from the AI model are not all correct. Please analyze by following the steps below based on relevant documents:
1. Which of the relevant documents support the AI model's analysis results? Which do not? Please directly cite sentences or paragraphs from the documents' content in your explanation.
2. Do you think whether the AI model's analysis results are reasonable? The prediction of mortality risk is higher or lower than the actual risk? Please provide your analysis based on the relevant documents, and disjudge the analysis results of the AI model if necessary.
3. Please provide your prediction of mortality risk as a number between 0 and 1.

Please think step-by-step and analyze the results based on relevant documents. Do not include any unsupported conclusions. Generate your output formatted as Dict{"result": Result, "explanation": Str(Your analysis)} without any additional information, where result is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the mortality risk prediction:

## Summary
    Please describe your task, summarize the patient's basic information and health status, and restate the AI model's prediction results along with the feature importance and partial statistic information.
## Documents Analysis
    Please analyze the important features identified by the models, determine whether the identified features are reasonable. If they are reasonable, provide and cite relevant literature, include quotations from the sources, and explain the reasoning. If the features are not reasonable, provide and rank important features in your analysis, cite relevant documents and explain. Ensure that the features you identify are present in the dataset.
## Prediction Analysis
    Please evaluate the AI models' prediction results: too low, too high, or reasonable? If it's not reasonable, please provide your own prediction results, represented as a float number between 0 and 1.
